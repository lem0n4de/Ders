- Epilepsy
  - Mechanism of Action - 1 - Promoting inactivated state of Na⁺ channels
    - *Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Topiramate, Valproic acid*
  - MOA - 2 - Enhanced GABA mediated synaptic inhibition
    - *Benzodiazepines, barbiturates* postsynaptic
    - *Vigovatrin, Valproic acid, tiagabin* presynaptic
  - MOA - 3 - Inhibition of voltage-activated T-type Ca⁺⁺ channels (Used for abscence seizures)
    - *Valproic acid, ethosuximide*
- Barbiturates cause sedation, are inexpensive and has low toxicity. Phenobarbital was the first effective organic antiseizure drug.
- Valproic acid has the risk of developing *fulminant hepatitis* in pt.

  - Greater efficacy than SSRIs for Major Depressive Disorder or depression w/ melancholia.
- MAOIs
  - *Hypertension when taken w/ tyramine containing food.*
  - *Irreversible*
- Lithium, mood stabilizer.
- First Generation Antipsychotics *Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists*
  - Haloperidol, delirium and dementia like short term symptomatic treatment
  - Chlorpromazine
- Second Generation Antipsychotics *5-HT2 receptor antagonists mostly*
  - Clozapine, first found SGA. Treatment refractory schizophrenia and agranulocytosis.
  - Risperidone, haloperidol like usage.
  - Aripiprazole blocks high level of DA but facilitates low levels
  - Amisulpride blockage of cortical dopamine receptor but not those in basal ganglia.
